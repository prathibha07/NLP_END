CoQA is a large-scale data set for the construction of conversational question answering systems. 
The CoQA contains 127,000 questions with answers, obtained from 8,000 conversations involving text passages from seven different domains.
The goal of the CoQA challenge is to measure the ability of machines to understand a text passage and answer a series of interconnected questions that appear in a conversation.
