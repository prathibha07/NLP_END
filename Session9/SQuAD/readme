The Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a set of reading comprehension data consisting of questions asked by social workers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to each question is a segment of text, or span, of the corresponding reading passage. 
With more than 100,000 question-answer pairs on more than 500 articles, SQuAD is significantly larger than previous reading comprehension datasets. 
SQuAD2.0 combines the 100,000 questions from SQuAD1.1 with more than 50,000 new unanswered questions written in a contradictory manner by crowd workers to look like answered questions.
